# Sales Analysis Project Overview:

The Sales Analysis project centers on utilizing Python for data extraction, visualization, and analysis, with Postgresql serving as the data source. The project harnesses my proficiency in Python and SQL for tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading. Exploration through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization, employing tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, is a key aspect of the project's approach.
